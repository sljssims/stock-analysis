# stock-analysis
Overview and Analysis 

The purpose of this analysis is to analyze stock data from 2017 and 2018 and generate a macro to run the data for each year.  Once the analysis was complete the code generated within Module 2 was refactored to run more efficiently.  

Stock performance in 2017 indicates that 11 out 12 ticker indexes show a positive return percentage for the year.  The top performing indexes recorded were DQ with 199.4% return for the year and ‘SEDG’ with a 184.5% return for the year. The only index with a negative return for the year was ‘TERP’ with a recorded -7.2% return for the year.

The stock performance in 2018 shows a lower return rate overall. 10 out of 12 tickers recorded a negative percentage return rate in the year 2018. 2 ticker indexes, ‘ENPH’ and ‘RUN’, show a positive return percentage for 2018.  
The analysis of both  years could conclude that stocks ‘ENPH’ and ‘RUN’ both remained positive for both years and may be a good investment for Steve’s parents. 

Initially when running the script, the time to run data for 2017 was .609375 and 2018 was .6054688.  After refactoring the time to run data for 2017 was .6015625 and 2018 was .6015625 confirming a slight improvement in macro efficiency.  

Refactoring Advantages and Disadvantages

Refactoring code gives us the advantage to use code previously written.  The code is tailored to meet the users’ specific needs.  Another advantage of refactoring is that it provides a way to detect errors easily and determine where efficiencies and improvements can be made. 
A disadvantage to refactoring is that one must familiarize themselves with code and understand its purpose.  Making additions or deletions to already working code could make it unstable and unusable. To determine if the code will be efficient; one must understand the code that is being refactored. If the code is not labeled well or identified, it could make the refactoring hard and cumbersome.

Refactoring this code proved to be easier due to the labels provided that describe what the code was doing.  This helps the user understand what the code is doing and if it is needed for the current use. To outline code that is added or deleted, constant testing needs to be performed to ensure that the code remains stable.
